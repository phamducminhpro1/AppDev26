Problem discussion 

Job searching is not easy. Many students aim for a job, often related to the major they are studying in. Finding and applying for a job is a complicated process. For students at the Eindhoven University of Technology, this is also a problem. An application that offers different jobs in the area of the university will be a solution.
Moreover, companies in the area of Eindhoven show a lot of interest in the next generations of engineers. Therefore, companies can post job requests on the app, which will only be visible to TU/e students. This results in a privilege for students studying in Eindhoven, and applying for a job will be easier and faster. 
The app is a social network app aimed at TU Eindhoven students. It helps TU Eindhovenâ€™s students discover their careers and find the perfect workplace. Students can access numerous job listings posted by companies on our platform. When students have questions, they can send direct messages to the recruiters to apply or ask questions about the job like salary, environment, interview process, etc.
